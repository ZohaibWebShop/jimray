  Shopify's official CAPTCHA implementation
  This snippet is now deprecated since we use data-shopify-captcha attribute
  and window.Shopify.captcha.protect method directly in forms
{% endcomment %}

  CAPTCHA is now handled automatically by Shopify when using:
  1. data-shopify-captcha="true" attribute on the form
  2. window.Shopify.captcha.protect(form, callback) method
  
  No additional rendering is needed as Shopify handles it internally
